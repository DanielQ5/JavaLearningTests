/*Intermediate Java Test 3: Coffee Shop Kiosk â€“ Menu with Switch Case, Enums & OOP
User Story:
As a coffee shop customer using a self-service kiosk,
I want to choose between ordering drinks, viewing store hours, checking loyalty points, or exiting,
so I can interact smoothly without staff help.

 **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**
Acceptance Criteria for Intermediate Test 3: Coffee Shop Order System (Using switch, OOP, and Interfaces)
Feature	Description
Menu System (switch-case)	User can choose from a list of drinks (e.g., Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino).

Track Total Orders (New)	Keep a session count of all drinks ordered.
Simulate Loyalty Points (New)	Increment points per order and show points summary after each transaction.
